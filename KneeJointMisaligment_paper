device accuracy in rendering desired forces, the tradeoff be-
tween spurious interaction forces due to misalignment and those
due to uncompensated inertia of the robotic links should be stud-
ied. For devices designed to assist the gait, this may be done
in a reliable way, since the dynamics involved in steady-state
walking are approximately periodic, and, therefore, predictable.
At faster walking speeds, the lower extremities produce higher
angular velocities and accelerations [15]. These affect the con-
tribution of robot inertia—and, possibly, its interaction with
joint misalignments, suggesting that walking speed must also
be included in the analysis.
   As a first step toward this direction, this study investigates:
1) how the introduction of a small controlled knee misalignment
in an exoskeleton for the lower extremities affects undesired
human/robot interaction forces, and how these forces eventually
affect kinematics and timing of the gait; 2) how the impact of
misalignment on the aforementioned biomechanical variables
compares with that of uncompensated inertia of the robotic links,
and what interactions may occur between the two factors; 3) how
the effect of these factors varies as the walking speed changes.
   To answer these questions, we conducted an experiment on
a small group of healthy subjects who walked in the active leg
exoskeleton (ALEX II) under different configurations of the
robot, with the device controlled in a transparent mode (i.e., nil

fitting of the robotic leg on the human. In practice, the mis-
alignments imposed in this study overestimate those that can
be reasonably expected in existing lower extremities power ex-
oskeletons.
    To measure flexion/extension angles of the human leg, poten-
tiometric goniometers2 were aligned to subject’s hip, knee, and
ankle joints by means of Velcro straps [see Fig. 1(a)]. Prior to the
actual recording, subjects familiarized with walking in the robot
for approximately 5 min [see Fig. 1(b)]. If necessary, the adjust-
ments of the robotic leg (except for the lengths of the thigh and
shank links) were further tuned to improve the wearer’s comfort.
Then, subjects walked in the treadmill at slow (0.8 m/s) and fast
(1.1 m/s) speeds without the robot (free-walking trials) for 3 min
at each speed. Subsequently, they underwent a set of 12 3-min
trials [see Fig. 1(b)], each corresponding to a different combina-
tion of robot inertia (factor In, with to levels: CI—Compensated
Inertia and UI—Uncompensated Inertia), walking speed (factor
Sp, with two levels: slow speed and fast speed) and knee joint
alignment (factor A, with three levels: short alignment, ideal
alignment, long alignment). Speed values were chosen based
on data from previous experiments with ALEX II [17], [18].
Changing robot alignment required the subject to doff the de-
vice as the experimenter adjusted the length of the thigh link
to the desired value. In ALEX II, this operation takes 2–3 min,
and is, therefore, more time consuming than changing the in-
ertia compensation mode or the treadmill speed. To simplify                    Fig. 2. (a) Relative position between the subject and the exoskeleton for short,

q = [qRH , qRK ]T is the vector of the generalized coordinates
of the robotic leg; qRH yields the orientation of the thigh link
with respect to a vertical axis pointing downward, and qRK is the
relative angle between the thigh and the shank links. Both angles
are positive in the direction of anterior motion [see Fig. 2(a)].
